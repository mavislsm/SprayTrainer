Readme

Mavis_Final_DM2008 is an Arduino file that utilizes both the 'data' and '(library)' folders to function correctly. BitVoicer11 was purchased on https://www.bitsophia.com/en-US/Store/Store.aspx at the price of USD4.90 during the time of this project. The functionality of this file is untested on machines without BitVoicer11 installed. 

The project title is Spray Trainer, and was connected to an arduino board and regular spray bottle from a hardware store (schematics attached). 

The essence of the project is to code an Arduino program integrated with BitVoicer11, a voice recognition program to automatically run a motor at certain angles to spray the bottle mechanically. For this project, BitVoicer11 is programmed to listen out for swear words (including some Singaporean swear words from dialects) that will trigger the code on Arduino.

IMPORTANT
For licensing reasons, the '(library)' folder does not include the BitVoicer11 program file, please purchase BitVoicer11 at https://www.bitsophia.com/en-US/Store/Store.aspx and include the 'BitVoicer11' folder with CPP and H files 'BitVoicer11.cpp' and 'BitVoicer11.h' respectively.
